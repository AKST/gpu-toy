    <h1>About</h1>
    <p>
      What I'd like to do create 2 step compute shader (i have never done this
      before), the steps work like so:
    </p>
    <ol>
      <li>
        <h2>Compute Sequential nonlinear portion for each country</h2>
        for each country (entityName), sequentially (over dataYear), read a
        observation (dataValue) (the previous periods output if exists or 1)
        and output a which will be read by the subsequent period. This means
        I can only run this for each country at a time. The pass looks roughly
        like this:
        <code>(dataValue: float, lastOut: float = 1.0) => float</code>
      </li>
      <li>
        <h2>Compute linear portion</h2>
        After this however the second step will output another input and this can
        be done independently for each period for each country. The pass looks
        roughly like this:
        <code>(periodOut: float) => float</code>
      </li>
    </ol>
    <p>
      At stage I just need help with the initial WebGPU setup as
      I am unfairly with using WebGPU generally, I need to setup
      the 2 compute steps and feed data from one step into the next
      and make sure it executes. For now each step will just produce
      the identity of its inputs (although the first should multiply).
